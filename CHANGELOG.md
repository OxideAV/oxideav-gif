# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Initial implementation per GIF87a / GIF89a specs.
- `compose` module — multi-frame compositor that walks every image
  block and applies the GIF89a §23 disposal-method state machine
  (None / Keep / RestoreBackground / RestorePrevious), honouring the
  §23.c.viii transparent index and the §18 Logical Screen background
  colour. Returns a `Vec<ComposedFrame>` of `RgbaCanvas` + per-frame
  delay.
- `registry` module + default-on `registry` Cargo feature wiring the
  GIF codec into `oxideav-core`'s `RuntimeContext` via the
  `oxideav_core::register!` macro. Exposes `GifDecoder` / `GifEncoder`
  trait impls + `register` / `register_codecs` / `register_containers`
  entry points. The macro-generated `__oxideav_entry` is re-exported at
  the crate root so `oxideav-meta`'s `register_all` can dispatch to it
  (this is the "workspace registry contract" — see workspace memory
  `project_register_macro_dispatch_contract`). Standalone consumers can
  opt out with `default-features = false` and the `oxideav-core` dep
  drops out of the build entirely.
