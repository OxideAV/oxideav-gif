# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `app_ext::ExifMetadata` + `GifImage::exif()` — typed view over the
  `Exif    ` Application Extension (Exif 2.3 §4.7.2). Mirrors the
  XMP / ICC pass-through pattern: identifier match yields the raw
  TIFF EXIF blob; the 3-byte authentication code is preserved on
  the typed struct so a decode → re-encode round-trip is byte-stable
  even when the producer used a non-default auth code.
- `GifImage::optimize_color_tables()` — encoder helper that hoists a
  shared per-frame Local Color Table into the §18 Global Color
  Table when every image frame carries the same palette. Saves
  `3 × 2^(size_bits + 1)` bytes per frame. Refuses to hoist when
  palettes differ (no-op, stream byte-identical to baseline).
- `decode_first_frame()` cover-frame fast-path that short-circuits
  at the first image-bearing block and discards every trailing
  block. Useful for thumbnail-style consumers that don't need the
  full animation timeline.

### Fixed
- LZW codec width-bump symmetry at end-of-input. The encoder now
  performs a phantom dictionary extension on its final-prefix
  emission, mirroring the decoder's own entry add. Without this,
  rasters whose penultimate in-loop assignment lands exactly on
  `2^W − 2` (e.g., a 16-pixel monochrome image at
  `min_code_size = 3`) wrote EOI at the old width while the decoder
  read at the new one. The fix is internal — encoded byte streams
  for the unaffected case are byte-identical to before.

- `playback` module — lazy `Playback` / `FrameIter` /
  `LoopingFrameIter` iterators that walk the §23 disposal-method
  state machine one frame at a time. Yields `PlaybackFrame`
  (`RgbaCanvas` + `Duration`) so a downstream player can `sleep` on
  the §23.c.vii delay directly. `LoopingFrameIter` honours the
  NETSCAPE2.0 *Looping* sub-block: no extension → 1 pass,
  `loop_count = 0` → infinite, `loop_count = N` → `N + 1` total
  passes per the de-facto convention. Works with the registry feature
  on or off.
- `app_ext` module — typed parsers + constructors for the three
  ecosystem-defined Application Extensions that ride on top of GIF89a
  §26: NETSCAPE2.0 *Looping* + *Buffering* sub-blocks
  (`LoopControl`), the Adobe XMP packet (`XmpPacket`), and the ICC
  colour profile (`IccProfile`). These layer on top of the raw
  `Block::Application` representation — the raw block stays in
  `GifImage::blocks` for byte-stable round-trip.
- `GifImage::loop_count()` / `netscape_buffer_hint()` /
  `xmp_packet()` / `icc_profile()` / `application_extensions()`
  convenience accessors.
- Initial implementation per GIF87a / GIF89a specs.
- `compose` module — multi-frame compositor that walks every image
  block and applies the GIF89a §23 disposal-method state machine
  (None / Keep / RestoreBackground / RestorePrevious), honouring the
  §23.c.viii transparent index and the §18 Logical Screen background
  colour. Returns a `Vec<ComposedFrame>` of `RgbaCanvas` + per-frame
  delay.
- `registry` module + default-on `registry` Cargo feature wiring the
  GIF codec into `oxideav-core`'s `RuntimeContext` via the
  `oxideav_core::register!` macro. Exposes `GifDecoder` / `GifEncoder`
  trait impls + `register` / `register_codecs` / `register_containers`
  entry points. The macro-generated `__oxideav_entry` is re-exported at
  the crate root so `oxideav-meta`'s `register_all` can dispatch to it
  (this is the "workspace registry contract" — see workspace memory
  `project_register_macro_dispatch_contract`). Standalone consumers can
  opt out with `default-features = false` and the `oxideav-core` dep
  drops out of the build entirely.
